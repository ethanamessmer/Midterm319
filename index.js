/*
Having this file was just part of the rubric, our javascript work was mostly done in the games, 
hangman uses javascript to correspond different images and a json file for a word folder essentially.
Snake also uses a good amount of DOM for different processes throughout the page. Another thing to note is 
that our website isn't really image based but I think we still meet the two pages with corresponding images 
with the index having thumbnails and the hangman having different stages of hung. Just want to make sure we get all the points we can lol
